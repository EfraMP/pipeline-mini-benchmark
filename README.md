# Mini-benchmarking of a Nextlfow pipeline for MS-based proteomics

During the senior year of my undergraduate studies, I did an internship in which I designed, developed, tested, benchmarked and deployed a bioinformatics pipeline for mass spectrometry-based
proteomics data processing in a core facility setting. This repo contains the code and results of the benchmarking. To view the knitted webpage in your browser go to [this URL](https://eframp.github.io/pipeline-mini-benchmark/).
